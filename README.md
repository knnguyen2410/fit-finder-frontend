# Description

Fit Finder aims to improve users' health by enhancing their fitness journey. Fit Finder serves to meet the needs of two user groups - gym goers and gym owners.
Both groups can use Fit Finder to connect, find specific facilities and services, and grow their community.

Fit Finder is an Angular application that allows users to access and manage gym data. 
* Users can view gyms, as well as the equipment and amenities the gyms offer. 
* Gym owners can register for an account, allowing them to list their gyms and gym offerings.

To see how this application handles data, check out the [Fit Finder API backend application](https://github.com/knnguyen2410/fit-finder-backend) which it communicates with.

# Development Process

To ensure a systematic and efficient development process, I started by wireframing the pages for the Fit Finder Angular application. As the backend REST API was already created, I had a clear understanding of the necessary components and how data should be displayed to both logged-in and non-logged-in users.

Following the wireframes, I adopted an incremental development approach. I began building the application one component at a time, focusing on functionality and data flow. After completing each component, I ran Jasmine tests to verify that everything was functioning correctly. This iterative testing approach allowed me to catch any issues early on and maintain code quality.

Once I had the minimum required data displayed, I proceeded to implement the next features of the site. By breaking down the development process into manageable chunks, I ensured that each feature was implemented thoroughly before moving on to the next one.

After completing all the features, I revisited the application's styling. This approach aligned with the principles of Agile methodology, allowing me to deliver a fully functional product that met the requirements. By prioritizing functionality first and then refining the design, I was able to maintain an efficient development pace and deliver a polished end product in a timely manner.

By adhering to this development process and adopting an agile mindset, I ensured that the Fit Finder Angular application was developed systematically, thoroughly tested, and met the requirements of the project.

# Hurdles

Throughout the development process of the Fit Finder Angular application, I encountered several significant hurdles that tested my problem-solving skills and required proactive communication with instructors and peers.

One of the challenges I faced was integrating Bootstrap into the project. While learning Angular, I also had to familiarize myself with Bootstrap, which added an additional learning curve. I had to understand how to structure content on a page, retrieve data, and dynamically route components based on the data. This complexity posed a significant challenge that required careful attention and problem-solving.

Another major hurdle I encountered was ensuring secure access to endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). I needed to pass the security JWT to my endpoints to restrict access to only logged-in owners who could modify gym data. Implementing this authentication and authorization mechanism was a complex task that involved understanding the flow of tokens and securely passing them through the application.

To overcome these hurdles, I employed a proactive approach. I engaged in open communication with my instructors and peers, seeking their guidance and expertise. By breaking down the challenges into smaller segments, I was able to analyze and debug my code effectively. Through collaborative discussions and feedback, I gained insights and discovered solutions to address the specific hurdles I faced.

By embracing a proactive and collaborative mindset, I successfully navigated through the challenges encountered during the development process. These hurdles not only tested my technical skills but also provided valuable learning opportunities and fostered growth as a developer.
